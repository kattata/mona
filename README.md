# Mona

Mona teaches you something new about art every day. 
- You will be shown a new, famous artwork every day
- You can save your favorites and view them later

Technical details
- Frontend framework - Nuxt 3
- Artworks come from [The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/). I utilized Nuxt's server routes to customize the requests and make it possible to expand the data sources later on.
- Authentication was developed with Supabase Auth

The idea is inspired by a student project I was a part of at Business Academy Aarhus - [Mona Daily Art](https://github.com/kattata/mona-daily-art), a cross-platform application built with React and Ionic.

```bash

npm install
